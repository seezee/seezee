# Hi, I'm Chris 👋 👨🏻‍💻

I'm a web developer dedicated to making websites to help individuals and organizations achieve their goals. I also photograph and write at Mercury Photo Bureau. I work with HTML, PHP, JavaScript, and CSS. I wrote several plugins to provide solutions for my own websites and decided to share them with the community.
